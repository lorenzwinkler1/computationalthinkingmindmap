                    Purpose of this machine was the calculation of logarithmic-tables, which could be approximated through power series.

                    <p>
The analytic engine did only exist as a concept, and it was not possible to build it at its time (for example due to heat).
                 </p>
                    <p>
                    While it did never exist, it still is called "the oldest computer". Its concept is amazing, considering the circumstances.

                    <p>
                    There are efforts to build that machine now.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The first \"programs\" for that machine (which were basically the first programs at all) were written by Ada Lovelance and did for example calculate the bernoulli-numbers.

                    <h3>Enigma</h3>
                    <p>
The Enigma was developed by the germans during World War 2. It was used to encrypt all messages. Decrypting it was very time intensive, and could not be done in time, so that the message was still to be used.
                 </p>
                    <p>
The allies, under the lead of Alan Turing were able to build a machine, called "bomb", which was able to decrypt messages very fast. 
                      </p>
                    <p>
                    <h4>Important sidenote</h4>
                    Alan Turing commited suicide, after he was sentenced to take hormon pills, because he was homosexual, to cure that \"disease\". <br>
It is sad, how at one point, someone helps to save the world, and afterwards that very same person is driven into suicide, for a \"crime\", which should not be one.
                    </p>
                    <p>
It took until about 60 years after Turing's death, until the british queen spoke out a royal pardon for Turing.
</p>
<p>
I would recommend watching <a class="src" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2084970/">The imitation game</a>. While not being a hundred percent accurate about how the creation of "the bomb" was carried out, it still tells Turing's story in a very good way and adresses the - unfortunately - still very present topic of homophobia.
